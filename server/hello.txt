1. (all dependencies installed to create backend)
npm init -y // used this to add package json files
npm install bcryptjs //to encrypt passwords that are going to be stored in mongodb database
npm install cloudinary //to upload profile or chat images in cloud storage
npm install cors //allows backend to connect with any frontend url
npm install dotenv // we can use environment variables in our backend server
npm instll express //to create backend server
npm install jsonwebtoken // using that we can generate token and will authenticate users using this token
mongoose //using this we can connect our project with mongodb database
socket.io // enable real time chat messaging
 

2. node_modules folder gets created which contains all our packages
3. we add type in package.json as bydefault its commonjs, will change it to module(we can use import statement in the project due to this)
4.to start the server we write node server.js but we have to restart it after making any chnages so to avoid that we add 
npm install nodemon //now we can start server using nodemon // but before that we chnage the script
instead of test add server and in that value add server nodemon server.js

//now to start we just write npm run server in our server intergated terminal
